# No-fluff
We don't like unnecessary fluff:  

- No unnecessary webpages; include all relevant information in guides in Git.
- Keep the pricing model simple.
- Use clear language; state it as it is without adding non-valuable adjectivesâ€” the unit test: "If you read this headline, do you clearly know what it is or dose?"
- Consistency is key; ensure a seamless transition from website to app to documentation, where users don't need to remap anything in their heads because everything is 1:1 across all layers.
- We don't do lengthy sales cycles! Try it, liking it, then use it. If not, then don't. Simple.
- In support, we don't chit-chat; we help by being formal, short, and to the point. You contact us when you need help, we will help. Efficient. Fast. Done.
